# ALX Pace — Self-Pace Tracker

A responsive, **mobile-first** web app that helps ALX Africa learners track their
progress through their self-paced curriculum. No sign-up, no login — everything
lives in the browser. Styled after **alxafrica.com**'s live brand system.

| Program | Track | Length | Modules | Items |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Data Analytics** | — | 14 weeks | 4 | 27 lessons |
| **Creative Tech** | Content Creation | 22 weeks (5 buffer) | 5 | 250 lessons, activities & quizzes |
| **Creative Tech** | Graphic Design | 32 weeks (10 buffer, 2 half weeks) | 10 | 373 lessons, activities & quizzes |

## Quick start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # http://localhost:5173  (Vite dev server)
```

Other scripts:

```bash
npm run build          # production build to dist/
npm run preview        # serve the production build
npm run lint           # ESLint (flat config)
npm test               # Vitest unit tests (pacing, parser, schedules, programs, forecast)
npm run parser:check   # verify all three program CSVs with the production parser in Node
```

Every push and pull request runs lint → unit tests → parser verification → build
via [GitHub Actions](.github/workflows/ci.yml); deployment to GitHub Pages only
runs after those gates pass on `main`.

> Requires Node 18+ (developed on Node 24).

## What it does

| Area | Behaviour |
| --- | --- |
| **Program picker** | First visit asks *Data Analytics or Creative Tech?* — and for Creative Tech, *Content Creation or Graphic Design?* Change it any time from the hero card; each program's ticks are kept separately. |
| **Zero-login state** | Program, name, start date and completed lessons persist in `localStorage`. |
| **Pacing engine** | Enter a start date → the app computes the current week of *your* program and shows exactly what to work on. The week advances live at midnight, even with the tab left open. |
| **Current Focus** | The precise Module + Week + lessons for *this* week, with checkboxes. |
| **Catch-up weeks** | Creative Tech buffer weeks turn the focus card into a catch-up list: the oldest still-open items from earlier weeks. |
| **Graded Milestones** | Evaluation quizzes, graded tests, integrated projects, module quizzes and mastery projects due this week are surfaced prominently. |
| **Progress** | Overall % complete across every item in the program, plus per-week counts. |
| **Full roadmap** | Collapsible week / module browser (buffer and ½ weeks flagged); the current week auto-expands. |
| **Edge states** | No program → picker · future start date → countdown · past the final week → graduation · no date → onboarding · storage reset → clean defaults. |
| **Theming** | Light (default, matching alxafrica.com) and deep-navy dark mode, persisted. |

### The four learner states

```
no-program (picker)  →  no-start-date  →  future (countdown)  →  active (week 1..N)  →  completed (graduation)
```

Learners who used the tracker before programs existed (they have a start date
or ticked lessons but no `program` key) are pinned to Data Analytics on their
first load, so their tracker opens exactly as before — no picker, no lost ticks.

## 📱 Install on your phone

The app is a **PWA** — visiting the live URL once is enough to install it like a
native app (standalone window, ALX home-screen icon, works offline afterwards):

- **Android (Chrome)**: open the app → tap the **⋮** menu → **Add to Home screen**
  (or tap the **Install app** prompt when it appears).
- **iPhone/iPad (Safari)**: open the app → tap **Share** (□↑) → **Add to Home
  Screen** → **Add**.
- **Desktop (Chrome/Edge)**: click the install icon in the address bar.

Progress is stored on the device, so the installed app picks up exactly where the
browser left off.

## 🔔 Weekly reminders

Learners can opt in via **Enable weekly reminders** in the footer. Two delivery
modes, best available wins:

1. **Local (zero infrastructure, on by default)** — Periodic Background Sync: the
   service worker wakes and shows the learner's latest status ("Week 3 — 2 graded
   items due", or the catch-up count on a buffer week) composed from data
   mirrored on-device. No data leaves the phone.
   Chromium on Android/desktop; installed app recommended.
2. **True Web Push (dormant until activated)** — works with the app fully closed,
   including iOS 16.4+ home-screen installs. Everything is wired: VAPID keys live
   as repo secrets, [`push/worker.js`](push/worker.js) is a ready-to-paste
   Cloudflare Worker (KV-backed subscription store), and
   [`.github/workflows/remind.yml`](.github/workflows/remind.yml) sends every
   Monday 08:00 WAT via [`scripts/send-reminders.mjs`](scripts/send-reminders.mjs).
   Activation steps are documented in
   [`src/lib/pushConfig.js`](src/lib/pushConfig.js) — deploy the worker, paste its
   URL, done. Until then the workflow exits as a no-op.

## 📊 Anonymous usage stats (dormant until configured)

[`src/lib/analytics.js`](src/lib/analytics.js) can report aggregate, cookieless
tallies to a free [GoatCounter](https://www.goatcounter.com) site: app opens,
installed-vs-browser, and a once-per-device-per-day program / week-number /
pacing-status event (`program-gd`, `gd-week-5`, `status-behind`; DA keeps its
original bare `week-N` names) — never anything identifying a learner. Do Not Track and
Global Privacy Control are honored, and no third-party script runs (plain GET
beacons). Off by default: set `GOATCOUNTER_SITE` in
[`src/lib/analyticsConfig.js`](src/lib/analyticsConfig.js) to activate.

## How the data works (deterministic by design)

This project applies the **Deterministic Tool & Data Normalization** principle: the
curriculum is a fixed developer asset and parsing is a pure, predictable state
machine — no AI, no guessing, same bytes → same model every time.

- **Source of truth:** one CSV per program in [`src/data/`](src/data) — the real ALX
  self-paced curricula. Learners never see a file input.
  - [`da-schedule.csv`](src/data/da-schedule.csv) — Data Analytics
  - [`cc-schedule.csv`](src/data/cc-schedule.csv) — Creative Tech · Content Creation
  - [`gd-schedule.csv`](src/data/gd-schedule.csv) — Creative Tech · Graphic Design
- **Program registry:** [`src/lib/programs.js`](src/lib/programs.js) lists each
  program's family (drives the two-step picker), sheet layout and CSV file.
- **Build-time bundling:** the CSVs are imported with Vite's `?raw` suffix
  ([`src/lib/schedule.js`](src/lib/schedule.js)) so they are compiled straight into the
  bundle — the curriculum data needs no runtime `fetch` and is never missing or
  stale. (The Poppins typeface loads from Google Fonts with a system-font
  fallback, so the app remains fully functional without it.)
- **RFC 4180 parser** ([`src/lib/csvParser.js`](src/lib/csvParser.js)) handles the
  messy realities of a spreadsheet export: quoted cells containing commas and
  **newlines** (the Integrated Projects span two lines), escaped `""`, and mixed
  CRLF/LF line endings.
- **Forward-fill:** the export uses *merged cells*, so `Module` and `Week` are blank
  on continuation rows. `forwardFill()` carries the last value downward, so every
  item is deterministically tied to its module and week.
- **Two sheet layouts, same five columns:**
  - *DA* (`Module | Week | Lessons | Check Your Understanding | Graded`) — one row
    per lesson; its CYU line and graded milestone ride along.
  - *Creative Tech* (`Module | Week | Lessons | Activity | Evaluation quiz`) — one
    item per row: a lesson, an activity, or a graded quiz / mastery project.
    Buffer weeks hold a single `Buffer / catch-up week` marker, which declares the
    week but is not a task.
- **Stable ids:** lesson ids are content-derived slugs
  (`da-1-w1-ways-of-work`, `gd-5-w14.5-working-with-imagery`), not row positions —
  inserting or removing a CSV row can never silently re-map a learner's saved
  completion state. Module codes namespace them, so one `completedLessons` array
  holds every program's progress without collisions.
- **Verification:** [`scripts/verify-parser.mjs`](scripts/verify-parser.mjs) runs the
  **production parser** against all three CSVs in plain Node and asserts program
  length (14 / 22 / 32 weeks), module counts, a gap-free day timeline, buffer and
  half weeks, forward-fill integrity, multi-line cell parsing, graded
  classification, one mastery project per Creative Tech module, and id uniqueness
  within and across programs. Run it with `npm run parser:check`.

### The pacing formula

Implemented in [`src/lib/pacing.js`](src/lib/pacing.js). For a plain N-week
program (Data Analytics) it is exactly the original spec:

```
elapsedDays = today − startDate            (whole days, local midnight)
currentWeek = min(N, max(1, ⌊elapsedDays / 7⌋ + 1))
```

The Graphic Design sheet also has **half weeks** (`Week 13 (½ week)`) followed by
weeks labelled mid-week (`Week 13.5 (Buffer)`, `Week 14.5`, …). So every schedule
carries a day timeline built from its labels, and pacing looks the elapsed day up
in it:

```
startDay(Week W) = ⌈(W − 1) × 7⌉           (a mid-day start begins next morning)
endDay(Week W)   = startDay(next week)     (last week: a full week, or half if "½ week")
totalDays        = endDay(final week)      DA 98 · CC 154 · GD 224
```

On a uniform timeline this reduces to the formula above (unit-tested), and the
target finish date is always `start + totalDays − 1`.

Dates are parsed as **local** dates (not UTC) so the calendar day never shifts in
negative timezones.

## localStorage contract

| Key | Type | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `program` | `"da"` \| `"cc"` \| `"gd"` \| `""` (not chosen) | `""` — or `"da"` for pre-existing learners (one-time migration) |
| `learnerName` | string | `""` (unset — the greeting shows a "Your name" prompt) |
| `startDate` | ISO date string `YYYY-MM-DD` | `""` (unset) |
| `completedLessons` | JSON array of lesson ids | `[]` |
| `alx-theme` | `"light"` \| `"dark"` | `"light"` |

Completed-lesson ids are validated against the active program's bundled schedule
(and deduplicated) on read, so stale or corrupt entries are silently dropped — a
defensive guardrail. Ids from the *other* programs stay in storage untouched, so
switching program and back restores each program's progress.

## Branding

Design tokens sampled from the live **alxafrica.com** site (July 2026), typeface
**Poppins** (via Google Fonts, with a system-sans fallback):

| Token | Hex | Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Deep Navy | `#03134F` / `#020B33` | hero banner, dark-mode surfaces |
| Cobalt | `#0452F0` (`#0345C9` for small text) | primary brand blue, CTAs, focus ring |
| Lime | `#C4E878` / `#DAF2A7` | signature accent, chips, current-week highlight |
| Violet | `#5F3DC4` | graded-milestone alerts, exams |
| Green | `#02B75E` | integrated projects, completed weeks |
| Amber | `#EAB308` | graded tests |
| Ink | `#1C1F2A` | body text on light |
| Off-white | `#F8F8F8` | page background (light) |

The header wordmark and the duotone learner portraits in the hero widget are the
official assets from alxafrica.com (this is an internal ALX learner tool).

Built for **375px+** smartphone browsers: 44px minimum tap targets, safe-area
insets, WCAG-AA text contrast in both themes, `prefers-reduced-motion` support,
and a theme-aware focus ring.

## A note on the source CSVs

The bundled CSVs are the curricula as provided:

- **Data Analytics** — verbatim, with one surgical correction: the Week 12 graded
  cell in the original export contained an accidental duplicated paste of the
  project title ("…Maji NdogoIntegrated Project…"), fixed to the single title.
- **Content Creation / Graphic Design** — the `CC` and `GD` sheets of the Creative
  Tech self-paced workbook, exported cell-for-cell (columns A–E, blank rows kept;
  the parser skips them).

Edit a file in `src/data/` and re-run `npm run parser:check` to update a
curriculum. To add a program, drop its CSV in `src/data/`, register it in
`src/lib/programs.js` and `src/lib/schedule.js`, add its name to
`t.programs` in `src/i18n/translations.js`, and give it a block in the
verification script.
